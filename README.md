### Binary Addition Calculator

This Java program allows you to add two binary numbers together. Simply input the binary strings, and it will compute their sum. 

#### Usage

1. **Input**: Enter the first binary string when prompted. Then, enter the second binary string.
2. **Output**: The program will display the binary sum of the two input strings.

#### How it Works

The program takes two binary strings as input and adds them together using binary addition rules. It iterates through the strings, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost digit), adding corresponding bits along with any carry from the previous addition. The sum is computed digit by digit, considering the carry if present, and constructing the resulting binary sum string.

#### Example

```
Enter the first binary string: 101
Enter the second binary string: 110
Binary sum: 1011
```

#### Instructions

1. **Java Installation**: If you haven&#39;t already, you need to install Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system. You can download and install it from [Oracle&#39;s website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. **Compile**: Compile the `BinaryAddition.java` file using `javac BinaryAddition.java`.
4. **Run**: Execute the compiled program using `java BinaryAddition`.
5. **Follow Prompts**: Enter the binary strings as prompted and observe the binary sum.

#### Note

- This program assumes valid binary input. It doesn&#39;t handle non-binary characters.
- For best results, input binary strings of equal length. If lengths differ, the shorter string is treated as if it were padded with leading zeros.
